## Python One Word Story

  Each person inputs their name and then they are told the story so far, after reading they are allowed to add ONE word. Then that word is added and if that person inputs their name again they will be told they can not add another word, but can read they story.

    Names of the past users : Names.txt
    The story               : Story.txt
    
## Admin mode
  In MacOS mainAM.py is the standard code but with a admin mode added to clear names/story and exit the script. This functionality is planned to be added to windows in the future. The default password and username are:
  
Username (Name): Admin

Password: AdminAccessPassword4132

## Other Notes
  The MacOS version should work with linux, but this has not been tested.
